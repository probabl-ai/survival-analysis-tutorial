# ## 1. What is right-censored time-to-event data?
#
# ### 1.1 Censoring
#
# Survival analysis is a **time-to-event regression** problem, with censored data. We
# call censored all individuals that didn't experience the event during the range of the
# observation window.
#
# In our setting, we're mostly interested in right-censored data, meaning we that the
# event of interest did not occur before the end of the observation period (typically
# the time of collection of the dataset):
#
# <figure>
# <img src="assets/censoring.png" style="width:80%">
# <figcaption align = "center"> <i>image credit: scikit-survival</i> </figcaption>
# </figure>
#
# Individuals can join the study at the same or different times, and the study may or
# may not be ended by the time of observation.
#
# Survival analysis techniques have wide applications:
#
# - In the **medical** landscape, events can consist in patients dying of cancer, or on
#   the contrary recovering from some disease.
# - In **predictive maintenance**, events can consist in machine failures.
# - In **insurance**, we are interesting in modeling the time to next claim for a
#   portfolio of insurance contracts.
# - In **marketing**, we can consider a user churning as an event, or we could focus on
#   users becoming premium (members that choose to pay a subscription after having used
#   the free version of a service for a while).
#
# Answering questions like:
# - What is the probability that a new user churn in 6 months? 1 year? 5 years?
# - How long does it take for this user to churn with a probability of 50%?
#
# As we will see, for all those applications, it is not possible to directly train a
# machine learning-based regression model on such a **right-censored** time-to-event
# target since we only have a lower bound on the true time to event for some data
# points. **Naively removing such points from the dataset would cause the model
# predictions to be biased**.
#
# %% [markdown]
#
### 1.2 Our Tasks
#
# Some notations:
#
# We denote the observed time-to-event $T = \min(T^*, C)$, where:
# - $T^* \in \mathbb{R}_+$ is the event time for an hypothetical unlimited observation
#   window.
# - $C \in \mathbb{R}_+$ is the censoring time
#
# In summary, we can observe $(\bold{X},T,\Delta) \sim D$, where:
# - $\bold{X} \sim \mathcal{X}$ are our covariates: information about the
#   individuals at the time of making the prediction.
# - $T = \min(T^*, C)$ with $T \in \mathbb{R}_+$, the censored time-to-event.
# - $\Delta = T^* < C$ with $ \Delta \in [0, 1]$, the event indicator, 0 is a
#   censored observation.
#
# We sometimes assemble all the observable information related to the target as
# the joint $Y = (T, \Delta)$.
#
# However, we are primarily interested in the conditional distribution $T^*|\bold{X}$.
#
# Our main quantities of interest to estimate are:
#
# - **The Survival Function** represents the probability that an event doesn't occur at
#   or before some given time $t$:
#
# $$S^*(t|\bold{x})=P(T^*>t|\bold{X=x})$$
#
# - **The Cumulative Incidence Function** is the inverse of the survival function, and
#   represents the probability that an event occur before some given time $t$:
#
# $$F^*(t|\bold{x}) = 1 - S^*(t|\bold{x}) = P(T^*\leq t|\bold{X=x})$$

# %% [markdown]
#
# ### 1.3 Our target `y`
#
# For each individual $i\in[1, N]$, our survival analysis target $y_i$ is comprised of
# two elements:
#
# - The event indicator $\delta_i\in\{0, 1\}$, where $0$ marks censoring and $1$ is
#   indicative that the event of interest has actually happened before reaching
#   the end of the observation window.
# - The censored time-to-event $t_i=\min(t^*_{i}, c_i) > 0$, that is the
#   minimum between the date of the hypothetical event $t^*_i$ and the censoring
#   date $c_i$. In a real-world setting, we don't have direct access to $t^*_i$
#   when $\delta_i=0$. We can only record $t_i$.
#
# We define the compound target $y_i = (t_i, \delta_i)$ as a tuple of the two
# observables for each individual.
#
# Here is how we represent our target for a synthetic predictive maintenance
# dataset of 10,000 observations collected by the operator of a fleet of
# trucks:

# %%
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_file
import pandas as pd

DATA_URL = "https://github.com/probabl-ai/survival-analysis-tutorial/releases/download/data-2025-05-19/"
file_url = DATA_URL + "truck_failure_10k_any_event.parquet"
y = pd.read_parquet(fetch_file(file_url, folder="truck_dataset"))
y.round(1)

# %% [markdown]
#
# ### 1.4 Why is it a problem to train time-to-event regression models?
#
# Without survival analysis, we have two naive options to deal with right-censored time
# to event data:
# - We ignore censored data points from the dataset, only keep events that happened and
#   perform naive regression on them.
# - We consider that all censored events happen at the end of our observation window.
#
# **Both approaches are wrong and lead to biased results.**
#
# Let's compute the average and median time to event using either of those naive
# approaches on our truck failure dataset:

# %%
y.loc[y["event"]]["duration"].median().round(1)

# %%
y_max_impute = y.copy()
y_max_impute.loc[~y["event"], "duration"] = y_max_impute["duration"].max()
y_max_impute["duration"].median().round(1)

# %% [markdown]
# We can compare them to the mean of the ground-truth event time $T^*$, that we
# would obtained with an infinite observation window.
#
# Note that we can access to the random variable $T^*$ because we generated
# this synthetic dataset. With real-world data, you only have access to $T =
# \min(T^*, C)$, where $C$ is a random variable representing the censoring
# time.

# %%
file_url = DATA_URL + "truck_failure_10k_any_event_uncensored.parquet"
y_uncensored = pd.read_parquet(fetch_file(file_url, folder="truck_dataset"))
y_uncensored["duration"].median().round(1)

# %% [markdown]
# We can see that either naive approach leads to a biased estimate of the
# median time. The ground-truth median time to event lies between the two naive
# estimates.

# %% [markdown]
#
# ## 2. Modeling
#
# Let's start with unconditional estimation of the any event survival curve.
#
# ### 2.1 Unconditional survival analysis with Kaplan-Meier
#
# We now introduce the survival analysis approach to the problem of estimating
# the time-to-event from censored data. For now, we ignore any information from
# $X$ and focus on $y$ only.
#
# Here our quantity of interest is the unconditional, or marginal, survival
# probability:
#
# $$S(t)=P(T^* > t)$$
#
# This represents the probability that an event doesn't occur at or before some
# given time $t$, i.e. that it happens at some time $T > t$.
#
# The most commonly used method to estimate this function is the
# **Kaplan-Meier** estimator. It gives us an **unbiased estimate of the
# survival probability**. It can be computed as follows:
#
# $$\hat{S}(t)=\prod_{i: t_i\leq t} (1 - \frac{d_i}{n_i})$$
#
# Where:
#
# - $t_i$ is the time of event for individual $i$ that experienced the event,
# - $d_i$ is the number of individuals having experienced the event at $t_i$,
# - $n_i$ are the remaining individuals at risk at $t_i$.
#
# Note that **individuals that were censored before $t_i$ are no longer
# considered at risk at $t_i$**.
#
# Contrary to machine learning regressors, this estimator is **unconditional**:
# it only extracts information from $y$ only, and cannot model information
# about each individual typically provided in a feature matrix $X$.
#
# In a real-world application, we aim at estimating $\mathbb{E}[T^*]$ or
# $Q_{50\%}[T^*]$. The latter quantity represents the median survival duration
# i.e. the duration before 50% of our population at risk experiment the event.
#
# We can also be interested in estimating the survival probability after some
# reference time $P(T^* > t_{ref})$, e.g. a random clinical trial estimating the
# capacity of a drug to improve the survival probability after 6 months.
#
# Let's compute the Kaplan-Meier survival function on our truck failure
# dataset:

# %%
from lifelines import KaplanMeierFitter

km = KaplanMeierFitter()
km.fit(
    durations=y["duration"],
    event_observed=y["event"],
)
ax = km.plot_survival_function()
ax.axhline(y=0.5, linestyle="--", color="r", label="median")
ax.set_ylabel("Survival Probability")
ax.set_ylim(0, 1)
ax.legend()

# %% [markdown]
# Since we have censored data, $\hat{S}(t)$ doesn't reach 0 within our
# observation window. We would need to extend the observation window to
# estimate the survival function beyond this limit. The **Kaplan-Meier
# estimator does not attempt the extrapolate beyond the last observed event**.

# %% [markdown]
#
# We can read the median time to event directly from this curve: it is the time
# at the intersection of the estimate of the survival curve with the horizontal
# line for a 50% probability of failure.
#
# Let's use the `scipy` library to compute this value by using interpolation to inverse
# the survival function (from probability to time):

# %%
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d

time_to_quantile_level = interp1d(
    km.survival_function_["KM_estimate"], km.survival_function_.index
)
time_to_quantile_level(0.5).round(1)

# %% [markdown]
#
# This empirically confirms that the median time to event estimated by the
# Kaplan-Meier estimator applied to the censored observations is very close to
# the ground-truth median time to event measured directly on the uncensored
# synthetic data.

# %% [markdown]
#
# ### 2.2 Kaplan-Meier estimation on subgroups derived from `X`
#
# We can enrich our analysis by introducing covariates, that are statistically
# associated to the events and durations.

# %%
file_url = DATA_URL + "truck_failure_10k_features.parquet"
X = pd.read_parquet(fetch_file(file_url, folder="truck_dataset"))
df = X.join(y)
df

# %% [markdown]
# Let's stratify using the brand variable:

# %%
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
for brand_name, group in df.groupby("brand"):
    (
        KaplanMeierFitter()
        .fit(
            durations=group["duration"],
            event_observed=group["event"],
        )
        .plot_survival_function(ax=ax, label=brand_name)
    )
ax.set_ylabel("Survival Probability")
ax.set_ylim(0, 1)

# %% [markdown]
#
# ### 2.3 Model evaluation
#
# The Brier score and the C-index are measures that **assess the quality of a predicted
# survival curve** on a finite data sample.
#
# #### Integrated Brier Score (IBS)
#
# The **[time-dependent Brier
# score](https://soda-inria.github.io/hazardous/generated/hazardous.metrics.brier_score_survival.html)
# is a proper scoring rule**, meaning that an estimate of the survival
# probability at a given time horizon has minimal Brier score if and only if it
# matches the true survival probability induced by the underlying data
# generating process. In that respect the **Brier score** assesses both the
# **calibration** and the **ranking power** of a survival probability
# estimator.
#
# It is comprised between 0 and 1 (lower is better). It answers the question
# "how close to the real probabilities are our predictions?".
#
# <figure>
# <img src="assets/BrierScore.svg" style="width:80%">
# </figure>
#
# The **[Integrated Brier
# Score](https://soda-inria.github.io/hazardous/generated/hazardous.metrics.integrated_brier_score_survival.html)**
# (IBS) is the average of the time-dependent Brier score over a time horizon
# $[t_{min}, t_{max}]$. The IBS is a proper scoring rule for the estimation of
# the survival function (i.e. the survival probability at any given time
# horizon).
#
# The **IBS values** are comprised **between 0 and 1**, and **lower is better**.
#
# #### Concordance-Index (C-index)
#
# The **C-index** only assesses the **ranking power**: it is invariant to a monotonic
# transform of the survival probabilities. It only focus on the ability of a predictive
# survival model to identify which individual is likely to fail first out of any pair of
# two individuals.
#
# It answers the question: "given two individuals, how likely are we to predict
# in the correct order that one has experienced the event before the other?"
#
# Conceptually, it is quite similar to the Kendall's Tau coefficient or the ROC
# AUC. **C-index values** are comprised **between 0 and 1** and **higher is
# better**, where 1 means perfect ranking and 0.5 is equivalent to a random
# ranking or constant ranking (irrespective of the information available in
# $X$).
#
# Let's put this in practice. In the following, we use the KM estimated
# survival for all individuals in the datasets, irrespective of the value of the
# covariates $X$:

# unconditional or marginal estimator: it can't be used to rank individuals
# predictions as it predicts the same survival curve for any row in `X_test`.
#
# In the following, we will see how to use the information in `X` to improve
# upon this baseline by fitting conditional survival models.

# ### 2.4 Cox Proportional Hazards
#
# The hazard rate $\lambda(t)$ represents the "speed of failure" or **the
# probability that an event occurs in the next $dt$, given that it hasn't
# occurred yet**. This can be written as:
#
# $$\begin{align} \lambda(t) &=\lim_{dt\rightarrow 0}\frac{P(t \leq T < t + dt
# | P(T
# \geq t))}{dt} \\
# &= \lim_{dt\rightarrow 0}\frac{P(t \leq T < t + dt)}{dtS(t)} \\
# &= \frac{f(t)}{S(t)} \end{align} $$
#
# The Cox PH model is the most popular way of dealing with covariates $X$ in
# survival analysis. It computes a log linear regression on the target $Y =
# \min(T, C)$, and consists in a baseline term $\lambda_0(t)$ and a covariate
# term with weights $\beta$. $$\lambda(t, x_i) = \lambda_0(t) \exp(x_i^\top
# \beta)$$
#
# Note that only the baseline depends on the time $t$, but we can extend Cox PH
# to time-dependent covariate $x_i(t)$ and time-dependent weights $\beta(t)$.
# We won't cover these extensions in this tutorial.
#
# This methods is called ***proportional*** hazards, since for two different
# covariate vectors $x_i$ and $x_j$, their ratio is: $$\frac{\lambda(t,
# x_i)}{\lambda(t, x_j)} = \frac{\lambda_0(t) e^{x_i^\top \beta}}{\lambda_0(t)
# e^{x_j^\top \beta}}=\frac{e^{x_i^\top \beta}}{e^{x_j^\top \beta}}$$
#
# This ratio is not dependent on time, and therefore the hazards are
# proportional.
#
# Let's run it on our truck-driver dataset using the implementation of
# `lifelines`. This models requires preprocessing of the categorical features
# using One-Hot encoding. Let's use the scikit-learn column-transformer to
# combine the various components of the model as a pipeline:

# %%

# There are two ways to read this plot:

# First we could consider our **predictive survival analysis model as a probabilistic
# regressor**: if we want to **consider a specific probability of survival, say 50%**,
# we can mentally draw an horizontal line at 0.5, and see that:
#
# - test data point `#0` has an estimated median survival time around 300 days,
# - test data point `#1` has an estimated median survival time around 800 days,
# - test data point `#2` has an estimated median survival time around 450 days...
#
# Secondly we could also consider our **predictive survival analysis model as a
# probabilistic binary classifier**: if we **consider a specific time horizon, say 1000
# days**, we can see that:
#
# - test data point `#0` has less than a 20% chance to remain event-free at day 1000,
# - test date point `#3` has around a 50% chance to remain event-free at day 1000...

# Let's try to get some intuition about the features importance from the first 5
# truck-driver pairs and their survival probabilities.
