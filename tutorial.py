# ## 1. What is right-censored time-to-event data?
# 
# ### Censoring
#
# Survival analysis is a time-to-event regression problem, with censored data. We call
# censored all individuals that didn't experience the event during the range of the
# observation window.
#
# In our setting, we're mostly interested in right-censored data, meaning we that the
# event of interest did not occur before the end of the observation period (typically
# the time of collection of the dataset):
#

# </figure>
#
# Individuals can join the study at the same or different times, and the study may or
# may not be ended by the time of observation.
#
# Survival analysis techniques have wide applications:
#
# - In the **medical** landscape, events can consist in patients dying of cancer, or on
#   the contrary recovering from some disease.
# - In **predictive maintenance**, events can consist in machine failure.
# - In **insurance**, we are interesting in modeling the time to next claim for a
#   portfolio of insurance contracts.
# - In **marketing**, we can consider user churning as events, or we could focus on
#   users becoming premium (members that choose to pay a subscription after having used
#   the free version of service for a while).
#
# Answering questions like:
# - What is the probability that a new user churn in 6 months? 9 months?
# - How long does it take for this churn probability to be 50%?
#
# As we will see, for all those applications, it is not possible to directly train a
# machine learning-based regression model on such a **right-censored** time-to-event
# target since we only have a lower bound on the true time to event for some data
# points. **Naively removing such points from the dataset would cause the model
# predictions to be biased**.

### Our Tasks
#
# Some notations:
#
# We denote the observed time-to-event $T = \min(T^*, C)$, where: 
# - $T^* \in \mathbb{R}_+$ is the event time
# - $C \in \mathbb{R}_+$ is the censoring time
#
# We observe $(\bold{X},T,\Delta) \sim D$, where:
# - $\bold{X} \sim \mathcal{X}$ are our covariates
# - $\Delta \in [0,1]$ is the event indicator, 0 is a censored observation.
#
#However, we are primarily interested in the distribution $(\bold{X}, T^*, \Delta) \sim
#\mathcal{D}^*$, particularly the joint distribution $T^*, \Delta|\bold{X}$.
#
# Our main quantities of interest to estimate are:
# - The Survival Function: $S^*(t|\bold{x})=P(T^*>t|\bold{X=x})$. This represents the
#probability that an event doesn't occur at or before some given time $t$  - The
#Cumulative Incidence function: $F^*(t|\bold{x}) = 1 - S^*(t|\bold{x}) = P(T^* \leq t
#\cap \Delta=1|\bold{X=x})$

#
# ### Our target `y`
#
# For each individual $i\in[1, N]$, our survival analysis target $y_i$ is comprised of
# two elements:
#
# - The event indicator $\delta_i\in\{0, 1\}$, where $0$ marks censoring and $1$ is
#   indicative that the event of interest has actually happened before the end of the
#   observation window.
# - The censored time-to-event $d_i=min(t_{i}, c_i) > 0$, that is the minimum between
#   the date of the experienced event $t_i$ and the censoring date $c_i$. In a
#   real-world setting, we don't have direct access to $t_i$ when $\delta_i=0$. We can
#   only record $d_i$.
#
# Here is how we represent our target:

# %%
from hazardous.data import make_synthetic_competing_weibull

X, y = make_synthetic_competing_weibull(
    n_events=1, n_samples=50, random_state=0, return_X_y=True
)
y.head()

# %% [markdown]
#
# ### Why is it a problem to train time-to-event regression models?
#
# Without survival analysis, we have two naive options to deal with right-censored time
# to event data:
# - We ignore censorted data points from the dataset, only keep events that happened and
#   perform naive regression on them.
# - We consider that all censored events happen at the end of our observation window.
#
# **Both approaches are wrong and lead to biased results.**
#
# Let's compute the average and median time to event using either of those naive
# approaches on our truck failure dataset. We will compare them to the mean of the
# ground-truth event time $T$, that we would obtained with an infinite observation
# window. 
#
# Note that we have access to the random variable $T$ because we generated this
# synthetic dataset. With real-world data, you only have access to $Y = \min(T, C)$,
# where $C$ is a random variable representing the censoring time.

# %%
event_mask = y["event"].astype(bool)
y.loc[event_mask]["duration"].median()

# %%
y_max_impute = y.copy()
y_max_impute.loc[~event_mask, "duration"] = y_max_impute["duration"].max()
y_max_impute["duration"].median()

# %%
_, y_uncensored = make_synthetic_competing_weibull(
    n_events=1,
    n_samples=50,
    random_state=0,
    return_X_y=True,
    censoring_relative_scale=0,
)
y_uncensored["duration"].median()

#
# Let's start with unconditional estimation of the any event survival curve.
#
# ## Unconditional survival analysis with Kaplan-Meier
#
# We now introduce the survival analysis approach to the problem of estimating the
# time-to-event from censored data. For now, we ignore any information from $X$ and
# focus on $y$ only.
#
# Here our quantity of interest is the survival probability:
#
# $$S(t)=P(T > t)$$ 
#
# This represents the probability that an event doesn't occur at or before some given
# time $t$, i.e. that it happens at some time $T > t$.
#
# The most commonly used method to estimate this function is the **Kaplan-Meier**
# estimator. It gives us an **unbiased estimate of the survival probability**. It can be
# computed as follows:
#
# $$\hat{S}(t)=\prod_{i: t_i\leq t} (1 - \frac{d_i}{n_i})$$
#
# Where:
#
# - $t_i$ is the time of event for individual $i$ that experienced the event,
# - $d_i$ is the number of individuals having experienced the event at $t_i$,
# - $n_i$ are the remaining individuals at risk at $t_i$.
#
# Note that **individuals that were censored before $t_i$ are no longer considered at
# risk at $t_i$**.
#
# Contrary to machine learning regressors, this estimator is **unconditional**: it only
# extracts information from $y$ only, and cannot model information about each individual
# typically provided in a feature matrix $X$.
#
# In a real-world application, we aim at estimating $\mathbb{E}[T]$ or $Q_{50\%}[T]$.
# The latter quantity represents the median survival duration i.e. the duration before
# 50% of our population at risk experiment the event.
#
# We can also be interested in estimating the survival probability after some reference
# time $P(T > t_{ref})$, e.g. a random clinical trial estimating the capacity of a drug
# to improve the survival probability after 6 months.

# %% [markdown]
# 
# We can read the median time to event directly from this curve: it is the
# time at the intersection of the estimate of the survival curve with the horizontal
# line for a 50% failure probility.
#
# Since we have censored data, $\hat{S}(t)$ doesn't reach 0 within our observation
# window. We would need to extend the observation window to estimate the survival
# function beyond this limit. **Kaplan-Meier does not attempt the extrapolate beyond the
# last observed event**.
